# README — The Red and the Black in America

## Overview

A concise primer on two overlapping themes in United States history: "Reds" (left-wing movements, including socialists and communists) and "Blacks" (African American communities and movements). This document summarizes key definitions, historical interactions, and themes for further study.

## Definitions

- Reds: political movements and organizations associated with socialism, communism, labor radicalism, and other left-wing ideologies — especially influential in the early–mid 20th century and subject to anti-communist repression (Red Scares).
- Blacks: African American communities, cultural and political movements (Reconstruction, Jim Crow resistance, Civil Rights Movement, Black Power, contemporary movements such as Black Lives Matter).

## Historical interactions (brief)

- Alliances: labor organizing, anti-lynching campaigns, and some civil rights efforts saw cooperation between leftist groups and Black activists.
- Repression: Cold War anti-communism and FBI surveillance targeted both leftist organizers and many Black activists, often undermining coalitions.
- Tensions: differences in priorities (class vs. race-focused strategies) created strategic and organizational disagreements.

## Key themes

- Race and class intersect in organizing and policy outcomes.
- State surveillance and legal repression shaped movements and alliances.
- Cultural influence: literature, music, and journalism reflect cross currents between radical politics and Black cultural expression.
- Continuity to present: debates over coalition-building and intersectional approaches continue in modern activism.

## Further reading / research starting points

- Library of Congress and National Archives collections on labor, civil rights, and COINTELPRO.
- Scholarly surveys on US leftist movements and African American history; search academic databases (JSTOR, Google Scholar).
- Local archival materials and oral histories for community-level perspectives.

## Purpose of this file

This README is a high-level orientation for a deeper repository of notes, sources, and document excerpts about the historical and contemporary relationships between left-wing politics ("Reds") and African American movements ("Blacks") in the United States.
